'''
Construct a probe object from a .probe file with:

    probe = Probe(filename)

The file should have a form something like:

    probes = {
        1: [
            (0, 1), (0, 2),
            (1, 2), (1, 3),
            ...
            ],
        2: [...],
        ...
        }

The file is a Python file which should define a dictionary variable probes,
with keys the shank number, and values a list of channel pairs defining the
edges of the graph.

The Probe object has the following attributes:

    num_channels
        The number of channels used (1+the maximum channel number referred to)
    channel_graph
        A dictionary with keys the shank number, and values being graphs. A
        graph being a dictionary with keys the nodes (channel number) and
        values the set of all connected nodes. (So each channel in an edge is
        referred to twice in this data structure.)
    shanks_set
        The set of shank numbers
    channel_set
        A dictionary with keys the shank numbers, and values the set of channels
        for that shank
    channel_to_shank
        A dictionary with keys the channel numbers and values the corresponding
        shank number.
    probes
        The raw probes dictionary definition in the file
